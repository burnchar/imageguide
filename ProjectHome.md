Most images online which use limited colors or are charts, graphs, or similar should be saved using the PNG format. PNG makes these images not only look much better to the viewer, but it generally makes them smaller and quicker to download as well.
Other images, such as photographs taken with a camera, are almost always best saved in JPEG format.

Unfortunately, most internet users do not know how image compression works and have no idea which format to save any particular image in.
ImageGuide helps you figure out which format to save an image in. It is designed to be extremely easy to use and supports all major platforms.

ImageGuide saves your image in both formats, using roughly the same amount of disk space, and allows you to see which looks better. If you cannot tell, it gives you the option of recommending a format, and can even save the file for you.


While ImageGuide does have the option of saving images, it is usually best to use a dedicated art program such as Adobe Photoshop or The GIMP. These programs generally have more refined image saving features and may be able to make your image smaller and better looking than ImageGuide. ImageGuide should be used primarily for deciding which format to use.

Because ImageGuide uses the colors recommended by your computer (the "system palette"), PNG images may not look as good as they could when using a program with smarter color tools. I hope to implement a color chooser (using the Median Cut or similar algorithm) at some future date.
